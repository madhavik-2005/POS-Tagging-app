when WRB

no DT
just RB

take VB
people NNS

your PRP$
good JJ
some DT
could MD
them PRP
see VB
other JJ

then RB
now RB
look VB
only RB
come VB
its PRP$
over RP
think VB
also RB
back RB
after IN
use VB
two CD
how WRB
our PRP$
work VN
first JJ
well RB
way NN
even RB
new JJ
want VB
because IN
any DT
these DT
give VB
day NN
most RBS
us PRP
the DT
be VB
to TO
of IN
and CC
i PRP
run VB
am VBP
going VBG
to TO
school NN
fast RB
work NN
work VB
is VB
dog NN
house NN
car NN
love VBP
eat VB
pizza NN
on IN
weekends NNS
study VB
hard RB
Then RB
update VB
the DT
distance NN
from IN
source NN
node NN
A NNP
to TO
B NNP
with IN
the DT
weight NN
of IN
the DT
edge NN
that WDT
connects VBZ
it PRP
with IN
A NNP
which WDT
is VBZ
a DT
similar JJ
way NN
also RB
update VB
the DT
distance NN
from IN
A NNP
to TO
C NNP
which WDT
was VBD
previously RB
infinity NN
infinity NN
least JJS
distance NN
from IN
to TO
so RB
mark VB
node NN
as IN
Similarly RB
the DT
next JJ
shortest JJS
is VBZ
so RB
mark VB
node NN
also RB
as IN
visited VBN
At IN
this DT
point NN
all DT
three CD
nodes NNS
of IN
the DT
graph NN
are VBP
visited VBN
Now RB
the DT
most RBS
important JJ
step NN
arises VBZ
here RB
as IN
it PRP
can MD
be VB
seen VBN
that IN
by IN
following VBG
this DT
algorithm NN
the DT
shortest JJS
distance NN
from IN
is VBZ
but CC
if IN
traveled VBD
the DT
distance NN
via IN
node NN
C NNP
that WDT
is VBZ
the DT
path NN
the DT
distance NN
will MD
be VB
as IN
so RB
As IN
is VBZ
less JJR
than IN
but CC
Dijkstra’s NNP
algorithm NN
gives VBZ
the DT
incorrect JJ
answer NN
as IN
5 CD
which WDT
is VBZ
not RB
the DT
shortest JJS
distance NN
Therefore RB
Dijkstra’s NNP
Algorithm NN
fails VBZ
for IN
negative JJ
cases NNS
Conclusion NN
Since IN
Dijkstra NNP
follows VBZ
a DT
Greedy JJ
Approach NN
once RB
a DT
node NN
is VBZ
marked VBN
as IN
visited VBN
it PRP
cannot MD
be VB
reconsidered VBN
even RB
if IN
there EX
is VBZ
another JJ
path NN
with IN
less JJR
cost NN
or CC
distance NN
This DT
issue NN
arises VBZ
only RB
if IN
there EX
exists VBZ
a DT
negative JJ
weight NN
or CC
edge NN
in IN
the DT
graph NN
So RB
this DT
algorithm NN
fails VBZ
to TO
find VB
the DT
minimum JJ
distance NN
in IN
case NN
of IN
negative JJ
weights NNS
so RB
as IN
an DT
alternative NN
Bellman-Ford NNP
algorithm NN
is VBZ
used VBN
to TO
find VB
the DT
shortest JJS
distance NN
in IN
case NN
of IN
negative JJ
weights NNS
as IN
it PRP
stops VBZ
the DT
loop NN
when IN
it PRP
encounters VBZ
a DT
negative JJ
cycle NN
If IN
we PRP
remove VB
back JJ
edges NNS
example NN
CB NNP
edge NN
in IN
the DT
above JJ
graph NN
from IN
a DT
directed JJ
graph NN
, ,
then RB
we PRP
can MD
use VB
Dijkstra NNP
for IN
graphs NNS
with IN
negative JJ
edges NNS
as IN
the DT
cases NNS
like IN
above JJ
